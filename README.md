NLP Deep Learning(Twitter Data Sentiment analysis)
This notebook explores sentiment analysis of Twitter data using a neural Network. We'll be using a dataset of tweets 
labeled with sentiment (positive or negative) to train a machine learning model that can predict the sentiment of new 
tweets. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:
Data Loading and Exploration: We'll load the Twitter data from a CSV file, then explore it by viewing the first few rows,
obtaining summary statistics, and checking for missing values. Data Visualization: We'll create visualizations to understand 
the distribution of sentiment classes 
(positive, negative, etc.) and analyze the most frequent words used in positive and negative tweets using word clouds.
Tweet Length Analysis: We'll explore the distribution of tweet lengths and analyze any relationships between tweet length and 
sentiment. Data Preprocessing: We'll handle missing values, remove irrelevant characters and links, and convert text into a 
format suitable for the machine learning model. Text Tokenization and Padding: We'll convert text into sequences of numbers 
using a tokenizer and pad sequences to a fixed length for model training. Model Training: We'll define and train a Long Short-Term 
Memory (LSTM) neural network model to classify the sentiment of tweets. Model Evaluation: We'll evaluate the model's performance on 
unseen data using metrics like accuracy.
